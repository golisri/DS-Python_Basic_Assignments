    "4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression in python is nothing but an legal combination of symbols (like a variable, constants, and operators) representing a value. An expression must have at least one operand (variable or constant) and have one or more operators. After evaluating an expression, we get a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, x+y*z-8 is an example of an expression, where +, * are operators; x, y, and z are variables, and 8 is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the operand is the value on which the operator is applied, and operators use constants and variables to form an expression.\n",

    "\n",
    "Expression : 2+2\n",
    "Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value. That means you can use expressions anywhere in Python code that you could also use a value.\n",
